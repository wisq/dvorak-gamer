# TODO

* Add sorting to tables, mainly the index.
  * Ideally, I was hoping to do this via [isortope](https://github.com/KurtPreston/isortope)
  * However, I'm having issues.  Follow up with [issue #19](https://github.com/KurtPreston/isortope/issues/19)
* Add authorship information if/when I get any third-party contributions
* Deal with different scores for each OS on a single game if/when it ever happens
