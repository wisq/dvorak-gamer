# FIXME: Figure out what's up with Borderlands.  I think it may be more complicated.
# It's correctly changing back to WASD when I restart in Qwerty, and it does bind to physical keys.
# But it's also ignoring my keybinding changes on restart.
# My install is pretty old, so maybe I (deliberately?) borked it at some point.  Try with a fresh config.
