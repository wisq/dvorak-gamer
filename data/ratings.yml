perfect:
  code: A
  name: Perfect!
  description:
    - Binds to raw physical keys, resulting in perfect support for all keyboard layouts.
    - Displays keys as per the current layout, even if you change your layout mid-game.
    - All in-game actions can be remapped, and all main keyboard keys can be used.
    - This is what all games should aim for!
  wrong-layout:
    - Any on-screen hints or prompts will be in your current layout.
    - $$TYPING_PROBLEMS$$.
    - You can safely change layouts while the game is playing.

remap:
  code: B
  name: Remappable
  description:
    - Binds to logical keys, so it's affected by your current layout.
    - All in-game actions can be remapped, and all main keyboard keys can be used.
    - You can play in Dvorak by rebinding all keys.
    - Or you can play in Qwerty, but $$TYPING_PROBLEMS$$.
  wrong-layout:
    - The game will be unplayable until you change to the correct layout.
    - You do not need to restart the game after changing layout.

remap-physical-startup:
  code: C
  name: Remappable, binds at startup
  description:
    - Stores keybindings as logical keys.  Binds to the corresponding physical keys on startup.
    - All in-game actions can be remapped, and all main keyboard keys can be used.
    - You can play in Dvorak by rebinding all keys.
    - Or you can play in Qwerty, but $$TYPING_PROBLEMS$$.
    - Be sure to start the game in the right layout!
  wrong-layout:
    - The game will bind to the wrong keys, rendering it unplayable.
    - You will need to restart the game to be able to play.

qwerty:
  code: D
  name: Qwerty Only
  description:
    - Binds to logical keys, so it's affected by your current layout.
    - You can't remap anything, so you'll have to play in Qwerty.
    - Fortunately, there isn't anything in the game that requires typing.
  wrong-layout:
    - You can change to Qwerty while the game is running.

# Plans for future ratings:
#
# If a game stores keybinds as physical keys and maps them to logical keys on
# startup, I think it's probably a C+.  Basically, it's still just as annoying
# as C in everyday usage (which is why it's not B-), but you don't have to do
# the one-time remap.
#
# C- will be for games that do the physical-logical mappery stuff, but at
# varying times in addition to startup.  Metal Gear Solid 5 comes to mind.
#
# I'm going to reserve E for games that need Qwerty but also involve a moderate
# amount of typing.  One candidate that springs to mind is Perfect World â€” I
# remember it had unremappable keys, but it's also an MMO, hence lots of
# social.
#
# F is for unplayable things.  The only one that comes to mind right now is
# "Elegy for a Dead World".  Writing peotry with unremappable movement keys =
# nope.
#
# A+ may be for games that specifically call out Dvorak and make themselves
# work with it.  "Epistory: Typing Chronicles" comes to mind.  However, this
# would only be if its mapping strategy didn't place it in a lower category!
#
# Otherwise, I'll add pluses and minuses based on whether a game makes an
# effort (plus) or manages to fuck things up even more somehow (minus).
