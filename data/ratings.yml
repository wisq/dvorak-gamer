# Plans for future ratings:
#
# If a game stores keybinds as physical keys and maps them to logical keys on
# startup, I think it's probably a C+.  Basically, it's still just as annoying
# as C in everyday usage (which is why it's not B-), but you don't have to do
# the one-time remap.
#
# C- will be for games that do the physical-logical mappery stuff, but at
# varying times in addition to startup.  Metal Gear Solid 5 comes to mind.
#
# I'm going to reserve E for games that need Qwerty but also involve a moderate
# amount of typing.  One candidate that springs to mind is Perfect World â€” I
# remember it had unremappable keys, but it's also an MMO, hence lots of
# social.
#
# F is for unplayable things.  The only one that comes to mind right now is
# "Elegy for a Dead World".  Writing peotry with unremappable movement keys =
# nope.
#
# A+ may be for games that specifically call out Dvorak and make themselves
# work with it.  "Epistory: Typing Chronicles" comes to mind.  However, this
# would only be if its mapping strategy didn't place it in a lower category!
#
# Otherwise, I'll add pluses and minuses based on whether a game makes an
# effort (plus) or manages to fuck things up even more somehow (minus).
