# About

The Dvorak Gamer Index tracks how well video games handle the Dvorak keyboard layout.

The goal is to serve as a video game buyer's guide for my fellow Dvorak keyboard users.

Potentially, it may also help raise awareness of keyboard layout-related issues in gaming.

## What is Dvorak?

This is a bit of a lengthy topic, so it's covered [in a separate page](dvorak.html).

## How does Dvorak affect gaming?

This is also a bit lengthy, and so it also gets [its own page](gaming.html).

## Can I contribute to the index?

Sure, if you want.  The source code of the site is available <a href="https://github.com/wisq/dvorak-gamer">on GitHub</a>, and there are instructions there on how to contribute.

You don't need to be a Dvorak user to contribute, but you will need to be comfortable with having multiple keyboard layouts installed, and switching between them as needed.  This is required in order to test how a game responds to different layouts, and changing layouts mid-game.

## Who are you?

I'm just a gamer who switched to Dvorak at some point.  If you really want to reach out to me for some reason, your best option is probably <a href="https://twitter.com/wisqnet" target="_blank">via Twitter</a>.

You can also see my game collection <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/wisq" target="_blank">on Steam</a>, but that's not a great way to reach me, because I generally don't accept unsolicited friend requests.

## Why a Mac keyboard?  Real gamers use Windows!

Real gamers use whatever system they want.

But really, it's just because Apple makes nice-looking keyboards.
